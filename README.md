# ImuFusion
##EKF IMU Fusion Algorithms<br>
1. orien.m uses Kalman filter for fusing the gyroscope's and accelerometer's readings, to get the IMU's attitude(quaternion).<br>
2. zupt.m implenments the so called 'zero-velocity-update' algorithm for pedestrian tracking(gait tracking), it's also a ekf filter.<br>
